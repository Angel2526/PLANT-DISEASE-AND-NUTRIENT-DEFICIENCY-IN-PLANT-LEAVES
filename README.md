# Nutrient-Deficency-Disease-Detection-of-Plant-leaves
This is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to upload images and detect diseases or nutrient deficiencies present in the images. The application utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on relevant data to make predictions.

# Features

Upload images for analysis

Detect diseases or nutrient deficiencies from the uploaded images

Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit

# Model

The CNN model used for prediction is trained on a dataset of images containing examples of various diseases and nutrient deficiencies. The model has been trained to recognize patterns indicative of these conditions in images.

# Technologies Used

ðŸ”¸Machine Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

ðŸ”¸Web Development: Streamlit for creating the web application

ðŸ”¸Data Collection: Dataset of plant leaves with annotated labels for different deficiencies and diseases from Kaggle

ðŸ”¸Programming Languages: Python
